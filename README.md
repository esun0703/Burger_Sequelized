# Burger With Sequelize
  Burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Node and MySQL used to query and route data in app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
